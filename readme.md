MeshCommander
=============

*** Intel has discontinued support for this tool. Please contact Intel support for alternatives ***

MeshCommander is a Intel(R) Active Management Technology (Intel(R) AMT) remote management tool. It's feature rich and includes a built-in remote desktop viewer for Hardware-KVM, a Serial-over-LAN terminal, IDER-Redirection support and much more. MeshCommander is built on web technologies and runs on many plaforms. In addition to being available as a stand-alone tool, MeshCommander was built to be very space efficient to that it can be uploaded into Intel AMT flash space to have it served directly from the Intel AMT web server. There are different ways to install and use MeshCommander.

Windows Installation
--------------------

On Windows, simply go to [MeshCommander.com/meshcommander](https://www.meshcommander.com/meshcommander) and download and install the MSI installer.


NPM Installation
-----------------

On Windows, Linux and MacOS, you can install MeshCommander from the Node Package Manager (NPM). Once you have NodeJS installed on your computer, you can do:

```
	mkdir meshcommander
	cd meshcommander
	npm install meshcommander
	node node_modules\meshcommander
```

This will start a small web server on port 3000 that you can access using a browser to use MeshCommander at http://127.0.0.1:3000.


Firmware Installation
---------------------

For Intel AMT 11.6 and higher, you can load MeshCommander directly into Intel AMT storage flash space. Depending on the activation mode, MeshCommander can replace the default Intel AMT web page on HTTP/16992 or HTTPS/16993 making the built-in web site much more capable. On Windows, you can download the [firmware installer here](https://www.meshcommander.com/meshcommander/firmware). On other platforms, you can use [MeshCMD](https://www.meshcommander.com/meshcommander/meshcmd) to load MeshCommander into Intel AMT.


MeshCMD Installation
--------------------

On Windows and Linux, you can download [MeshCMD](https://www.meshcommander.com/meshcommander/meshcmd), a command line tool for performing many Intel AMT management operations. Included in that tool is MeshCommander. You can start it up by running:

```
	meshcmd meshcommander
```

Like the NPM version, this will start an HTTP web server on port 3000. You can then access http://127.0.0.1:3000 from any browser to access MeshCommander.


Compiling MeshCommander
-----------------------

MeshCommander is a set of HTML web pages that can be used in many different ways. You can run it in a browser or in nw.js, you can run it as a stand-alone application or as a web application served from Intel AMT. Because of all the different roles MeshCommander can take and the unique requirement of being able to fit within 64k limit of Intel AMT file storage, MeshCommander has to be "compiled" using the [WebSite Compiler](https://meshcentral.com/tools/websitecompiler.zip) tool that currently only runs on Windows. WebSite Compiler will merge all of the html, css and js files into a single big file, it will run a pre-processor to remove portions that are not needed and then minify and compress the output as needed.
